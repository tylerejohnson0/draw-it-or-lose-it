# draw-it-or-lose-it

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client?
What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room is a game company that has tasked us to create a game called Draw It or Lose It. The game works as follows: there will be multiple teams, one image from a larger library will start to render over a 30 second window, during that time the first team  will try to guess what the image is, if they fail to do so the other team will have 15 seconds to guess before time is expired. The game already exists for android but it needs to be created for a web browser using Java.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I created a fairly in depth explanation of what what required with creating the application and laying out different options for what could be used to create the application 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
It is helpful to have a decent understanding of the overall expectations of what is expected for the application laid out in one document.
	
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would choose to spend more time understanding the differences in designing code for different OSs and further develop the table with the pros and cons of each available 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The users need were met by providing a way to login as well as following the UML diagram that kept the application class heirachy simple and out of site for the end user.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
In the future I will be sure to keep in mind the importance of a fully fledged dsign document and the benifits that they bring.
